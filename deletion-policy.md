## Requesting Account Deactivation

To deactivate your SACAI account and restrict access to your personal data, please send an email to
📧 **[development@clearaccess.co.za](mailto:development@clearaccess.co.za)**
using the subject line: **“SACAI Account Deactivation Request.”**

Your request must include:

* Your registered **email address** (used to log in)
* Confirmation that you would like your **SACAI account deactivated**

Once received, our team will verify your identity and process your request within **7 business days**. After deactivation, your account will **cease to exist for active use** unless you request **reactivation** at a later date.

## What Happens After Deactivation

When your account is deactivated:

* You will no longer be able to log in or access your SACAI profile.
* Your **email**, **profile image**, and **login tokens** will be disabled from use.
* Your account data will remain securely stored in our system to preserve **audit trails and institutional compliance** as required by SACAI and data integrity policies.

This ensures that academic and activity records remain available for **verification and auditing** but are **inaccessible for normal use**.

## Data That Remains Retained

Certain information cannot be permanently deleted due to audit, legal, and academic recordkeeping requirements. This includes:

* **User identifiers** (e.g., email address, account ID)
* **Audit logs** related to login and API interactions
* **Linked academic data** such as student marks, documents, and exam records

This retained data is securely stored, encrypted, and inaccessible to unauthorized users.
